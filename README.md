# yasi
yet-another-system-inspector (yasi) - a terminal-based, highly customizable system monitoring utility, written entirely in C++.
Dependencies: FTXUI by Arthur Sonzogni (https://github.com/ArthurSonzogni/FTXUI)

To get it up and running, we will have to build the project from source. Clone the directory, then ```cd``` (same hierarchy as ```src```) into it. Once there, issue the following commands:
```
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make
```

If no build errors are encountered, the build was successful and the application can be run as any other binary executable:
```
$ ./yasi
```

PS - Project still in beta phase!
